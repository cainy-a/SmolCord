# SmolCord

Ever think that Discord wastes a lot of space? Yeah, me too.

SmolCord makes Discord use space more effectively. Works best with 80% zoom. And yes, it improves cozy chat mode if you donâ€™t like the way compact looks.

## How to use
### Diskai
SmolCord is included in Diskai. Just go to `_features.scss` and set `$compact : true;`. There, done!  
If you use Diskai this method is recommended as it integrates nicely with the new user card style (if you have it enabled.
### BetterDiscord
Download [`smol.theme.css`](https://github.com/cainy-a/SmolCord/raw/master/smol.theme.css) and put it in your themes folder.
### Powercord
Clone the repo to your themes folder. Alternatively download the [zip](https://github.com/cainy-a/SmolCord/archive/master.zip) or [tar.gz](https://github.com/cainy-a/SmolCord/archive/master.tar.gz) and extract it.
### Vizality
Type this in a chatbox and you're done! (don't worry, it won't send as a message): `.theme install https://github.com/cainy-a/SmolCord`  
Alternatively, you can also use the method for Powercord on Vizality.
## I want to include it in my theme!
```css
@import url("https://cainy-a.github.io/SmolCord/smol.theme.css");
```
